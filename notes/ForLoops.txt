For loops are designed for counting (iterating)
Can have the variable inside the loop - most of the time you must declare the variable outside fot he loop

3 components:
for (
    int i = 0; //intialize or set up the loop
    i < length; //conditional, what will keep the loop looping until the condition is met
    i ++; //iteration or increment, how do we keep moving forward
)
{
    DO THE THING
}

How it is written:
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i ++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}

This code will also acheive the same goal, but is not used often in this circumstance (iterating)
int counter = 0;
do //do loop will always execute once before looking for the conditional
{
    Console.WriteLine(counter);
    counter ++;
}
while(counter < 5);

-OR-
int counter = 0;
while(counter < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine(counter < 5);
    counter ++;
}
